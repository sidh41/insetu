                            of terrorism and money laundering activities, and the theft of your identity, Federal law
                            requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that
                            identifies
                            each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will
                            ask
                            for your name, address, tax identification number (social security number or employer
                            identification number), date of birth, and possibly other information that will allow us to
                            identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents.
